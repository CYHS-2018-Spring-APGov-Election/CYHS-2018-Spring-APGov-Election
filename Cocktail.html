<h2>Wake Up America!</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Almost two hundred and fifty years ago our nation's founders, fed up with British oppression, founded this country. Striving for a prosperous future, they constructed a fluid form of government which would be able to change and adapt to fill the needs of the people. While a malleable government lends itself to significant improvement, it also leaves us open to greater corruption. Many of the politicians we have today betray the ideals of our nation. They dodge issues with their promises, avoiding the subjects which are requiem to improvement. They prefer to tell us what we want to hear rather than what we need. For these reasons, we choose to take a stand. We, the members of the Cocktail party, will not remain passive when the enemies of progress try to sedate us.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Our citizens, our families, and even our nation lie asleep, barred from progress and incapable of reaching our full potential. We call into the darkness "Wake up America!" Rise from your slumber and stand for what's right. We believe that the sole purpose of government is to protect and serve the people. Citizens should be allowed freedom of reasonable rights, given that they do not oppress or remove the rights of others. Also, Government is responsible for the prevention and detention of those who seek to harm our citizens and our country. The Cocktail party stands to cleanse the corrupt, protect the defenceless, propagate the American prosperity, and move toward a bright new millennium. We fervently plead you, the people, to "Wake up!" and join the movement to revive, improve, and enhance our nation.</p>

<h2>Tanner Marchant &mdash; Presidential Candidate</h2>
<img id="tannerImage" style="" class="item-border" src="Images/Cocktail/tanner.png" alt="the tan-man" width="306px" height="344px" />
<div><p width="444px" style="text-align: center; padding-left: 440px; width: 440px;">Tanner Marchant will fix this nation. Growing up on the streets of St. Louis, Missouri, Marchant lived through poor conditions. His mission growing up was to better both himself and the country he was living in. In order to do so, Tanner pursued a degree in political science. Having little wealth, Marchant applied to Harvard University on grades alone. He managed to get into the University with ease, thanks to his excellent academic profile. Funding college was a different matter entirely. During his summers, Marchant worked on his Uncle's farm in Nebraska. His Uncle always prided him on his work ethic, attributing his excellent yield of crops to Tanner's unmatched drive. After 8 years, Marchant achieved a PhD in Political Science, and quickly went into the workforce. Marchant managed to land a job in the Department of Labor. Having grown up in the city, he had some knowledge of industrial jobs, as well as his farming experience. After eight years in that department, Tanner was given a job in the treasury. He accepted this job with pride and excelled at it, regarded as a "rising star" by his peers. Now Tanner wishes to fix many of the issues he has found in the government.</p></div>

<h2>Bryce Linz &mdash; Vice-President Candidate</h2>
<img id="bryceImage" style="" class="item-border" src="Images/Cocktail/bryce.png" alt="the not-tan-man" width="310px" height="308px" />
<div><p width="444px" style="text-align: center; padding-left: 100px; width: 440px;">Bryce Linz is the candidate for you. Linz grew up in Richmond, Virginia, the state of the founding fathers. He embodies their principles in in his actions, and believes that their ideas about this nation have long been abandoned. Bryce also pursed a political career from an early age. Growing up, he saw a need for change in his country, and strived to be politically active. His career began in high school, where he held a position as Vice President of Student Council. After high school, he continued onto Yale University, where he acquired a Doctorate in Political Science. Linz met Marchant at a political convention, in which Harvard was competing with their student government. After a heavy debate, both discovered their views aligned, and have been friends ever since. Linz nows aims to aid Marchant in fixing the government and is eager to help provide a better future for all Americans.</p></div>

<h1>Political Stances</h1>

<h2>Gun Control</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Our party believes that gun control is a matter of both guns and people. We believe that heavier restrictions should be put on guns and stronger background checks should be in place. We also believe that more education on both guns and mental health is a key part of controlling the gun epidemic.</p>
<br />

<h2>Foreign Relations</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">We believe that the government should have an active role in world affairs. However, governmental officials are handling current foreign affairs incorrectly. We believe that a perspective shift is necessary to address issues facing our military today.</p>
<br />

<h2>Economic Trade</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">We believe that the government should have an active role in regulating the activities of large corporations. Regulating these businesses protects the privileges of our American citizens. In addition, we want to focus on economic growth worldwide that will not only boost our economy, but boost the World's as a whole.</p>
<br />

<h2>Immigration</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Our party stands for the assimilation of immigrants. We want to increase the ease with which it is to become a citizen, while still maintaining thorough background checks. Our party is open to pardoning illegal parents of children born on American soil.</p>
<br />

<h2>Affirmative Action</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Our party believes that affirmative action is unconstitutional and creates racial division. It increases racial tensions in our country. It also creates a problem because the best people for the job are not always picked.</p>
