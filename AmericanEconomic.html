<h3>Presidential Candidate at large</h3>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Jonathon N. Steck was born in 1976 in Connecticut to a middle income household. As a quiet and inquisitive child, he lived an intellectual childhood that piqued his interest in public policies. Due to hard times that befell his family, Steck and his family moved to York in 1982. Throughout his time at Central York High School, Jonathan saw the disarray that the political parties caused in America, especially for his classmates and family who were suffering from the stagnancy in government as the parties argued in deadlock. Driven by the desire to make a change, he worked diligently in high school and was rewarded with the honor of being valedictorian with a GPA of 4.001. He carried this passion to Dartmouth, where he became the president of the university's student body as well as the executive chairman of the university's political committee. Steck spent 7 years at Dartmouth on an accelerated track that combined the college's School of Graduate Studies and the Tuck School of Business, graduating summa cum laude with a Ph.D. in political science and an additional degree for economics.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding">With this prestigious degree, Steck returned to his home state of Connecticut in service of the state government. After two terms worth of service under the governor of Connecticut, Steck announced his candidacy to much community support. Winning with over a 70% popular vote, Steck assumed his position as governor in 2008. During his campaign trail, Steck had also met his wife, a prominent member of the Senate in support of his policies. Through his two terms in Connecticut as governor, Steck had made sweeping changes in the local government that revitalized the stagnant state, as well as propelled Connecticut to be one of the most environmentally and economically states in the US. Armed with experience, wisdom, and determination, Jonathan Steck looks to renew our decaying government the same way he did with Connecticut's.</p>

<h2>Amanda DiPaula</h2>

<h3>Vice-Presidential Candidate at large</h3>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Amanda R. DiPaula was born in 1982 in the bustling city of Chicago, Illinois. Throughout her childhood, Amanda was groomed for success, as her parents moved with her to attend the Stevenson High School, one of the best in Illinois. Quickly rising in the ranks, she graduated with top marks as the Salutatorian of her class with a GPA of 3.99, a near perfect score. Throughout her high school experience, Amanda had been active in politics and was the founder of her school's Model United Nations Club and won numerous state and national titles for debate. These activities served her well and helped her gain acceptance to Columbia University, renowned for its public policy department. At Columbia, Amanda pursued a master's degree in political science and a minor in Spanish. Her educational prowess along with her political outspokenness caught the attention of Mitt Romney, who tapped her as an assistant campaign manager for his bid for governor, and then a full time campaign manager for his run for the presidency.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Throughout her time touring the country with Romney on his presidential run, Amanda recognized many of the shortcomings and issues with our current political atmosphere. She realized that the political scene had become oversaturated with the involvement of interest groups, PACs, and lobbying. While campaigning with Romney, Amanda saw how many candidates slowly shifted their interests and positions to appeal to donors. Recognizing these changes in politics, she founded the American Economic Party with Jonathan Steck in an effort to restore the balance between the economy and politics in our country today.</p>
<br />

<h1>We're in the News</h1>
<p class="paragraph-padding">"It's not shocking news that our country is in trouble. We as a nation are more divided than ever before, and the clashing political parties strongly contribute to this divide. Interlocked in a competition to be the one in charge, our two most prominent parties have long forgotten their pledge to service the country in lieu of personal interests. Caught up in this maelstrom are us citizens--How can we be heard over the storm in Congress? It seems, for the past few years, that out parties have neither serviced the country nor the people."</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding">"Like many of us, Steck is tired of the two-party formula that has become ineffective and stagnant over the years. With the American Economic Party, he promises the change and reform that our country needs to reconcile its debts and rebuild America from the ground up. Emphasizing a focus on our economy, Steck's team believes that small changes in our economy can pave a road to a healthier government, infrastructure, and living conditions for our people. Together with Jonathan Steck, we can pave the way to a new, modern America."</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding" style="font-style: italic; text-align: right;">- Zhang, Steven, Editor of the NY Times</p>
<br />

<h1>Political Stances</h1>
<h3 class="paragraph-padding">The American Economic Party's beliefs and values firmly lie in putting the economy first. We believe that through a strong economy and weak economic hold on politics, many of the issues in America can be solved with a more citizen-centric stance.</h3>
<br />

<h2>Immigration</h2>
<h3 class="paragraph-padding">The Heart of the American Experience</h3>
<p class="paragraph-padding">As one of the most socially diverse countries in the world, America is the keystone example of the coming together of the world. While we support the expansion of our country's cultures, beliefs, and opportunities, we plan to focus our immigration efforts on reducing the influx of illegal immigrants, clarifying the process for legal immigration, and provide a path for current illegal immigrants to integrate into society.</p>
<br />

<h2>Environment</h2>
<h3 class="paragraph-padding">Creating a Greener World</h3>
<p class="paragraph-padding">We recognize the importance of the environment and the damage occurring towards natural resources worldwide. However, we are also concerned about the economic efficiency of investing in environmental sustainability without proper infrastructure. Our team plans to increase green initiatives and invest in renewable or clean energy research to lay down a strong foundation for a more environmentally sustainable future.</p>
<br />

<h2>Foreign Aid</h2>
<h3 class="paragraph-padding">Defending Our Interests Overseas</h3>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Foreign aid and international affairs have long been one of America's most outreaching policies. As a world superpower, our aid to many countries whether economic or militaristic helps to provide a stepping stone for many of these countries into the 21st century. However, our party believes that foreign aid is a big detriment to the American economy and the global market, with much of it going towards countries with oppressive governments. We plan to start a large shuffling of the foreign aid budget to make it more efficient and less supportive of oppressive governments.</p>
<br />

<h2>War Against Drugs</h2>
<h3 class="paragraph-padding">Educating and Decriminalizing</h3>
<p class="paragraph-padding">One of the reasons why the drug trade and drug usage have been prevalent in our country is because of the reputation secrecy and elusiveness that drugs have accrued. Decriminalizing drugs in America would be an important step in bringing drugs into the light and identifying and treating people who are addicted but too afraid to ask for help. This action would make it easier for addicts to receive help, drastically cut down on profits from the international drug trade, and reduce the amount of criminalized individuals in our country, thereby increasing the workforce and boosting the economy.</p>
<br />

<h2>Economy</h2>
<h3 class="paragraph-padding">Paving the Way for a Healthy Future</h3>
<p class="paragraph-padding">The founding principle of our party, the American economy is one of the most important players in the global market and provides a means support to more than 300 million people. We believe that the economy, being the massive entity that it is, comes first and will naturally provide benefits and social boosts for the citizens. As such, we must also control the effect of the economy on other facets of life and to prevent business from stepping over the rights of the people. To combat the ever-increasing grasp of the economy on citizens, we will move to diligently reduce the effect of tampering in government by businesses, such as lobbying or specific campaign donations. Additionally, our party supports the growth of small businesses and independent contractors while controlling the reach of oligopolies.</p>
