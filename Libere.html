<p class="paragraph-padding">The Libere Party is one of a few select parties that are working toward the reformation of the United States. Libere means “to be free” in Latin, and the party focuses on keeping the nation as a strong republic, while working to maintain a Capitalist economy. What separates this single party from the ideologies of the other parties? How can it’s presidential candidate, Michael Gilliland, differentiate himself from the rest of the pack? There are a lot of unique aspects to the Libere Political party; one being its different approach to changing and improving our country. The party works to target the divide in our society first, with the belief that a strong and understanding society is needed; this strength and unity can and should translate into economic and political success.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Many theorize and believe that the people with political power and authority work to separate and divide the nation for their own benefits. This is unacceptable to The Libere Party and it’s candidate, Michael Gilliland. Gilliland, with much political background, agrees with this belief stating, “My time as mayor opened my eyes and pulled back the curtains from the political window. Even at the mayor level, I sensed greed and a desire to create a divide, in order to generate profit and fame.” Many critics argue that this party is just like the other and highlight the issue with the unification of a heavily divided nation. Mr. Gilliland addressed these criticisms by counterarguing, “The world is not perfect and therefore we, as the Libere Party, understand that perfect unification and harmony is far from realistic. What we strive to do, is create an attempt to allow citizens to think and make their own opinions, while stressing the need to appreciate opposing views.” Gilliland’s Libere Party focuses on immigration, privacy and security, gun control, Healthcare, and the drug policy. </p>

<h1>Political Stances</h1>

<h2>Healthcare</h2> 
<p class="paragraph-padding">2.8 trillion dollars is spent annually on healthcare in the United States, which is way too much money. Libere is not in favor of Obamacare, it was too expensive and did not provide universal healthcare. Everybody was supposed to benefit from Obamacare, even the lower class. However, that did not happen because it was too expensive, which did not allow them to be able to afford it. 
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span class="AmericaFirstSolution">What we plan on doing:</span> Not completely getting rid of Obamacare, but reforming it. Healthcare needs to be less expensive, it should be universal as well. We want a publicly run insurance plan, which in about ten years will save us billions of dollars. Also, our medical malpractice system is spending way too much money on unnecessary medical services, we need to cut down on their budget. Our main priority is making sure all Americans are covered and can afford health insurance. We will do this by cutting budgets in the United States, reforming Obamacare, and creating a publicly ran insurance plan. 
​
<h2>Gun Control</h2> 
<p class="paragraph-padding">The second amendment gives us the right to bear arms. However, more than half a million firearms are stolen each year in the United States and more than half of stolen firearms are handguns, many of which are sold illegally. Around 40% of the guns acquired in the United States annually come from unlicensed sellers who are not required by federal law to conduct background checks on gun purchasers.
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span class="AmericaFirstSolution">What we plan on doing:</span> Libere believes that the second amendment is a key part of the American culture and it should be protected. However, we think that violent crimes involving guns are a major problem that desperately needs to be solved. Our plan is to still allow legal guns to be bought the way they are today, yet we need to crack down on illegal gun enforcement and illegal gun trafficking. We want to create a gun hotline that will field anonymous tips on illegal firearms. Also, we need an operating unit specifically aimed at capturing illegal firearms since we do not have one. 

<h2>Drug Policy</h2> 
<p class="paragraph-padding">Desperate times call for desperate measures. As valiant and noble the War on Drugs ideology is, an epidemic continues to rip apart the nation. Drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans under 50. As the death toll rises, morgues have begun to run out of space and are resorting to renting trailers to hold the dead. The ugly epidemic not only has affected those who have died, but has affected those who are near them as well. Children are losing their parents and parents are losing their children. Something has to be done in order to prevent further heartbreak.
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span class="AmericaFirstSolution">What we plan on doing:</span> As radical as it may sound, The Libere Party seeks to legalize all drugs. The ideology behind this is stemmed from the belief that, regardless of regulations, people will find ways to abuse these drugs. Although this thought may seems as if The Libere party expresses little hope in drug abusers, we believe that this understanding is crucial to taking the next step for the betterment of our nation’s people. In order to keep buyers coming, many drug dealers have sought to lacing their drugs with additional substances--with many of these substances being fatal. One prominent example of this is heroin, with it’s recent lacing of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. On top of its deadly effects, drugs also have negative societal effects. With an already heavily overcrowded prison system, drug use and other drug related crimes amount to 46% of the total prison population. The legalization of drugs would decrease prison population drastically, all the while preventing further deaths. The Libere Party would support and promote clean needle exchanges and a federally regulated drug exchange. It would allow private companies to produce such drugs, while following heavy regulations to protect the health of its citizens. Rehabilitation centers would be granted authority to use such drugs to wean patients off of their addiction, instead of going cold turkey. ​
​
<h2>Immigration</h2> 
<p class="paragraph-padding">More than 10 million undocumented immigrants currently reside in the United States and the illegal immigration rate is growing by 700,000 per year. They come to America primarily for better jobs. However, the problem does not lie within the economy, because they add value to the economy; the problem has to do with security. If all these immigrants are getting into our country, this effectively creates a cover for terrorists and criminals. 
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span class="AmericaFirstSolution">What we plan on doing:</span> Libere does not want to separate children from their families, we think people have the right to get their green card and become a citizen. The problem becomes security. We need a system that is going to monitor who is coming in and out of our country and do it effectively. Needless to say, we want to only allow 1,000,000 immigrants in our country every year. However, we want to help the people who are coming here to try and get away from bad conditions like in Syria. We would like to set up safe zones for these illegal immigrants to go to. America wants to help them from afar, while still creating a better environment for them. 
​
<h2>Privacy vs Security</h2> 
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy:</span> Privacy is having more freedom for the people to do what they want with the internet, and having less security in public facilities. Privacy is also not having civil rights taken away by security at facilities by getting either profiled or randomly selected. People can also be on certain websites as they please without the NSA trying to track you. You have the freedom with these things. 
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security:</span> Security is the idea that the more security the people have and the more it is enforced, the safer our citizens will be. For example, having security all over inside and out of public places, such as metal detectors in airports, security cameras in retail stores, and even military lasers in bank vaults. Security is a more authoritarian view and it shows that law and order is above all. The safety of humans is vital and the way to have that is in a security view. 
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span class="AmericaFirstSolution">What we plan on doing:</span> Security in our minds is much more valuable than the sake of privacy. In an airport, a person can walk through the door with a weapon and if there was not any security to detect the weapon, then someone could get hurt. Also, if we have more security, groups like the NSA, TSA, FBI, and the have the ability to select people and ask them a few questions to see if they are a terrorist or their intent is to do harm and foul to other people. Security allows us to track others on the internet and stop drug dealers on the black market as well as stop trafficking. Without these government agencies helping crack down on criminals, there would be more criminals. Simple as that.
