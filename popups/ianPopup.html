<h1>Ian Collins History</h1>
<p class="popup-text">After receiving numerous scholarships as well as a civil award for his work in the community, he attended the University of Pennsylvania where he majored in political science and minored in sociology. After graduating college he went straight into the workforce putting his newly acquired skills to work as a political consultant for a blossoming political media company. After spending two years providing advice and gaining insight into the structure and function of the company, he slowly climbed the ranks. After another year he had been able to strike a deal with the current founder and owner to take control of the company while providing a steady income to the current founder. Quickly he turned the company from political media company into a company which itâ€™s main goal is supporting the community. At first there was plenty of pushback mostly from the discontent people who went from writing blogs on what the Kardashians are wearing to breaking ground on a new homeless shelter. Slowly but surely Ian Collins had delivered upon his promises of the past, promises to help those in need in our community.</p>
<p class="popup-text">This was his life up until he was 36 when one of his closest friends and favorite advisor Kaden Wolfe suggested that he should run for president. After careful consideration and crunching the numbers he decided that he could, that he should. He should because deep down inside he feels that if he has the ability to do something great, to help or even save the lives of others it is his moral obligation to. Logically he brought Kaden Wolfe on as his running mate, hoping he would make a great VP. The rest of his team came from his expansive business dealing, from heads of tech companies which he had purchased to PR managers for his companies. This is the point where he is now, ready with a team of loyal friends and follows, to take the most powerful office in the land and put it to good use.</p>
<p class="popup-text">Ian Collins is a successful playboy, millionaire, businessman and philanthropist. Not only does his policies focus on the wellbeing of the working class in our nation, from tax cuts to health care reform. This can all be linked to how he wants to put America back on top, and he understands the way to do it is by supporting the backbone of our nation. Not only that he also has strong ideological views which though he stands his ground on some issues, he is always willing to hear and not dismiss the views of others. This is what sets him apart in my eyes, not only has he never gone after another candidate with a smear campaign or even backhanded comments. He complements what the other candidates do well and often offers friendly criticism. This is simply because he truly wants what is best for the country, be it him leading it or someone else. Thats is why he is getting my vote  who has always looked for new ways to help people. </p>
