<h1>Kaden Wolfe History</h1>
<p class="popup-text">Today we will be discussing a new and uprising political group known as “America First”. But more specifically the Vice President pick for their group. His name is Kaden Wesley Wolfe and I think he is a great pick. He is a military vet turned lawyer and hasn’t had too much to do with politics other than sharing his opinion so he can’t be another filthy politician so it seems. He was born and raised in a little town and wasn’t raised rich. His family was middle class so he can relate with a lot of the American people. Their group is right leaning with some leftist views. But at the end of the day the presidential candidate and vice presidential candidate are both very good picks.</p>
