<p class="paragraph-padding">Over the years, the United States has become a symbol for freedom, equality, and most of all, change. Its adaptability to current social standards has been noted worldwide, particularly in scenarios such as the abolition of slavery or womenâ€™s suffrage. However, as of late, it seems that these positive changes have come to a halt. Whether it is due to a shift in government focus to more economic issues, international relations, or anything of the sort, this lack of focus needs to be addressed as soon as possible. While other countries are continuously making reforms in order to improve living conditions within their borders, the United States has remained at a relatively constant rate of not changing anything drastically enough to make a difference. The members of the Bright Party disagree with this method of handling social issues and believe that with everything going on in our country, this needs to change.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Politicians today tend to lie, cheat, and steal their way to the top of the political food chain in order to get what they want--but not Daniella Feistritzer. She believes that change can happen, and it starts with every individual. Feistritzer promises to adjust gun laws, fix the issues in the immigration system, reduce unemployment, and most importantly, listen to what the American people have to say. For too long, we have been ignored by the government; but with the Bright Party and Feistritzer, we plan to change this and truly listen to what the citizens have to say. The Bright Party is the right party: vote Daniella Feistritzer.</p>

<h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
<h3 class="paragraph-padding">Our goal is to create unity, improve quality of life, and obtain equal opportunity for all Americans. We are committed to being transparent, inclusive, and informed in order to achieve a bright future for our country.</h3>

<h1>OUR VIEWS</h1>
<h2>Immigration</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">"Immigrants" should not be synonymous with "foreigners." To ensure the safety and security of our country, more extensive background checks should be implemented but the legal immigration process should not take nearly as long as it currently does.</p>

<h2>Gun Control</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Further gun control than what is currently implemented is strongly needed. More extensive background checks and proper licensing must be obtained, but increased regulations and enforcement will also need to be added (such as black market crackdowns).</p>

<h2>Abortion</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Abortion must remain legal and not be subject to removal from state governments. However, in order to prevent abortions, sex education classes should be adopted by all public schools.</p>

<h2>Unemployment</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Since 2009, the amount of high school graduates who attend college has considerably decreased due to the students staying home to work and support their families. However, jobs that do not require higher education often only pay minimum wage, which restricts many families from making ends meet. Citizens should not be bound to this lifestyle, so minimum wage should be slightly raised and the government should continue to provide jobs for the public.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">The government having complete control of healthcare heightens concern that the government may monopolize the healthcare industry all together, and the government's current healthcare regulations are too extensive. The government should have less involvement in the healthcare field, allowing for individuals to make their own medical decisions, increase breakthroughs in the medical field, and will reduce the cost of healthcare for Americans.</p>
<br />

<h1>Our Message to the American Voters</h1>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Change needs to happen, now. With our political ideology, a new sense of unity will lead our country like never before. As citizens begin to appreciate diversity and work towards the greater good, the United States will blossom into a country where discrimination is no longer tolerated and every child will be guaranteed equal opportunity amongst their peers.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding">We want every citizen to have a brighter future, and we know you want it too.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 200px;">
Sincerely, <br />
The Bright Party
