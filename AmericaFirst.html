<h1>Political Stances</h1>

<h2>Gun Control</h2>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">The United States has an estimated 88.8 guns per 100 people. Totaling about 270,000,000 guns, which is the highest total/per capita number in the world. 22% of Americans own one or more guns, 35% are men and 12% are women. Proposal of more gun control laws state that the Second Amendment was intended for militias. Gun violence would be reduced, that gun restrictions have always existed, and that a majority of Americans support new gun restrictions. There were 464,033 total gun deaths within the span of 1999 and 2013, with about  270,237 suicides, 174,773 homicides, and 9,983 unintentional deaths. Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide and by suicide. Firearms are the 12th leading cause of all deaths, representing 1.3% of total deaths topping liver disease, hypertension, and Parkinson’s disease, as well as deaths from fires, drowning, and machinery accidents. Of the 29,618,300 crimes committed within the span of 2007 and 2011, 0.79% of victims protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span class="AmericaFirstSolution">Solution: </span>We will require more background checks. Doing so we will require universal background checks for all purchases of firearms. This will make it harder for individuals with past harmful history to obtain a gun. We will also implement Red Laws. Red Laws will allow the authority to take firearms away from any individuals which are being investigated or have had tips made about them possibly preparing to commit a crime.</p>
<br />

<h2>Education</h2>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">In August of 2017 a poll asked how satisfied the public was when it comes to the quality of education that students receive from kindergarten to 12th grade. The results were as follows: 9% say they are completely satisfied, 38% say they are somewhat satisfied, 32% say they are somewhat dissatisfied, and 20% were completely dissatisfied. This comes as no surprise due to how “out in the open” the issues with our educational system is. This could be due to how teachers or even authority as a whole is no longer respected by the majority of students, which in turn results in a lack of a fundamental desire to learn or even obtain knowledge. Maybe it could also boil down to how the United States Educational system requires students to attend school less than nearly every other developed first world nation.</p>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">The next poll refers to which type of school the eldest child will be attending, the choices are: public, private, parochial (private school supported by church), and home schooled. The results were as follows: 88% were to attend public school, 4% were to attend private school, 3% were to attend a parochial school, and 3% were going to be homeschooled. It isn't surprising at all that the largest majority attend public school, this is why the public tends to agree that public schools need to have some improvements in not only the quality of education but also the diversity of education.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span class="AmericaFirstSolution">Solution: </span>Learn from other nations in regarding to education. Look to the others nations such as South Korea and Japan which are commonly ranked for the best educational systems in the world. Not only that, we are also allied with both so it would be to much of  a stretch to see them assist us.</p>
<br />

<h2>Immigration</h2>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">FAIR's 2010 study, "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers" estimated at $1.4 billion the annual state and local fiscal costs borne by Pennsylvania taxpayers resulting from an estimated 140,000 illegal aliens and 27,400 of their U.S.-born children.</p>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">The cost of incarcerating illegal aliens in Pennsylvania’s state, county, and independent city prisons amounts to more than $17.5 million a year — not including related law enforcement and judicial expenses or the monetary costs of the crimes that led to the incarceration.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span class="AmericaFirstSolution">Solution: </span>Enforce the current laws we already have. Allow ICE to have information on illegals in the state without giving warnings before they come. Also, we will create more regulations and have strong vetting for legal immigrants. (Public will decide on the issue)</p>
<br />

<h2>Drugs</h2>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">The public sees racial, socioeconomic, and geographic imbalances as a major factor in drug use/abuse, and drug possession convictions. This seems to be normal for the public, always looking to blame everything on racism or inequality, when the blame should be on those who deal and use these drugs.</p>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">Americans seemingly want to focus on drug treatment and crackdown on drug dealers as a means to address the “underlying issues” of substance abuse across the country. In all honesty treatment doesn't work with the majority of relapse rates ranging from 40% to 60%. Focus needs to lie on showing the fates of drug users, while allowing federal agencies to focus on drug dealers.</p>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">A poll regarding the legalization of marijuana had 64% of the populace surveyed saying that it should be legalized, while 34% said no, and 2% had no opinion. This comes as little surprise due to people seemingly pushing more and more each year for the legalization of marijuana, albeit for recreational or medicinal.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span class="AmericaFirstSolution">Solution: </span>We have to target the dealers and have much stricter punishments for the production and distribution of drugs. In addition, we will help those affected. This will allow an increase the quality and quantity of help that those who suffer addiction and withdrawal can turn to.</p>
<br />

<h2>Healthcare</h2>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">The United States spends more on health than any other economically comparable country, yet sees a consistently mediocre return on this investment.</p>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">The United States is especially badly on measures of affordability, access, health outcomes, and equality between the rich and poor. The United Kingdom ranked first, and the other countries in the comparison were Australia, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Germany, Canada, and France.</p>
	<p class="paragraph-padding">America does perform well, comparatively, when it comes to doctor-patient relationships, end-of-life care, and survival rates after major issues like breast cancer or strokes. However, the United States does less well on measures of population health: It had high rates of infant mortality and a low life expectancy at 60 years. It also has the highest rate of “mortality amenable to health care”—deaths that doctors and hospitals can prevent—and has experienced the smallest reduction in that measure in the past decade.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding"><span class="AmericaFirstSolution">Solution: </span>Reduce the cost of healthcare. Currently, healthcare is a burden on people that don't make much money. Our goal is to make it affordable to all class citizens in the United States. We would accomplish this by providing universal healthcare for the hardworking citizens.</p>
