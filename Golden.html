<h3 class="blockquote">"There is only one leader that will help us enter the golden age that we have dreamed of for far too long. Only one leader will fight for the American people. Trevor Blood for President." </h3>

<p class="paragraph-padding">Today our country finds itself in a very uncertain situation. Distrust in our political system is growing, the divide has almost never been worse, and many share a feeling of hopelessness and fear. It is in times like these that we look for a leader that can transform our country. This leader is none other than Trevor Blood.</p>
<p class="paragraph-padding">For far too long we have abandoned the American ideals that have led us to greatness. Trevor Blood is the only candidate that will lead this country to a new golden age. In this golden age, he will implement gun restrictions that work for the betterment of all Americans. President Blood will also finally crack down on the many flaws in our immigration system. In order for this country to prosper, our country needs a leader that understands how much of a reach the government should have.  Trevor will give people more choice and make abortion legal across all states. He is also going to implement tariffs on products imported from other countries in order to promote American goods. Lastly, Trevor is likely the only candidate that will give tax breaks to companies that are willing to keep their jobs domestic and provide more jobs to the American people.</p>

<h1>Political Stances</h1>

<h2>GUN REFORM</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Due to recent events such as the school shooting in Parkland change needs to happen with our current gun laws. The reform that we would like to see is more restrictive background checks to screen for mental health issues as well as making sure that all the proper information is entered in the system. We would also like to see the required age to buy any kind of firearm be raised to 21. Lastly, we would like to see a gun tax applied to all firearm sales This would keep all gun restrictions and sales within the government so that they can be appropriately regulated.</p>
<br />

<h2>INTERNATIONAL IMPORTS</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">In recent years America has been importing more than it exports. This is a major problem because we are sending more money and jobs to other countries because we can get their products cheaper. To combat this we would like to increase import tariffs to put an emphasis on buying American goods. The increase would help to make prices of American products more competitive in our economy. This increase in American made goods will help to boost our economy to new heights. </p>
<br />

<h2>ABORTION</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">Only about 20 states have made it legal under certain precautions for women to abort. The other 30 states have many laws that inhibit women the right to choose whether or not they can have this baby. We want more states to have choices for the women. After all, it should be up to the women to decide what happens. People who are not carrying this child should not have any say in what a woman does with her body. A variety of option should be easily obtainable for women, as you truly don't know what goes on in someone's life.</p>
<br />

<h2>DOMESTICATION OF JOBS</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">As globalization continues to progress, more and more jobs are being outsourced to different countries. This is because of cheaper labor and the lack tariffs. To bring jobs back to the American people we want to give corporations that operate in America a slight tax break. This break should help to entice them to keep their jobs and manufacturing in the United States. This will definitely improve our unemployment rate which, in turn, will help reduce strain on government spending associated with government assitance and relief programs. </p>
<br />

<h2>IMMIGRATION</h2>
<p class="paragraph-padding">The immigration issue in this country has been around for a long time but has recently become a hot button topic. This issue cannot be ignored. This ideology is firm on the idea that illegal immigration should immediately be shut down. Illegal aliens convicted of felonies or other serious crimes should face mandatory deportation. Additionally, sanctuary cities will lose federal support for their failure to comply with the laws of the country. After passing a comprehensive background check, new immigrants will be allowed to apply 4 immediate family members per year for American citizenship.</p>
